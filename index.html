            <p>Hey Lylwynn Gomez, I made this site just for you. Because you're amazing!.
                &nbsp;I will wait for you because honestly i don't want anyone else, Im willing to make that sacrifice.
                <br>But obviously i can't make you like me if you don't want to,I know im not like other guys out there handsome, 
                <br>has money, and a good face to show, But im trying to change myself because of you.
                <br>But please don't be pressured from my feelings, i know you like someone but that doesn't mean i'll stop
                <br>liking you. Man that sounded weird.
